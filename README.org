#+TITLE: Susopy - Sudoku Solver in Python
#+AUTHOR: Hamza Shahid

* WARNING: This project has moved to https://codeberg.org/bitblit/sudoku-solver-py 

* Description
Susopy aims to be a complete sudoku solver with a GUI and multiple solving algorithms.

* Why?
I like Sudoku and thought making a solver for it would allow for me to learn
more about Python, and have some fun!

* Milestones
  + +DONE Backtracking Algorithm+
  + TODO GUI

* Usage
First clone the repository:
#+begin_src sh
  $ git clone https://codeberg.org/bitblit/sudoku-solver-py 
#+end_src
Go into the directory:
#+begin_src sh
  $ cd sudoku-solver-py/tests/
#+end_src
Run the tests to check if it working:
#+begin_src sh
  $ ./run-tests.sh
#+end_src
It should start solving around 50 boards which are included in tests/boards.py
thanks to [[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/sudoku][this dataset]]. Algorithm tests are written in tests/test_algos.py
